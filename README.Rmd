# The **ped suite**: R packages for pedigree analysis

The **ped suite** is a collection of R packages for pedigree analysis, covering a variety of applications across several fields. The packages are designed to work harmoniously together, often allowing complex tasks to be solved in a few lines of code.

```{r logos-pedsuite, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/logos-pedsuite-wheel_1.png")
```

### Core packages
At the centre of the **ped suite** we find the package **pedtools**, on which all the others depend. In addition, several packages contain basic features often needed in many types of analysis. These are the *core* packages:

* [pedtools](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedtools): Creating and working with pedigrees and marker data
* [forrel](https://github.com/magnusdv/forrel): Forensic pedigree analysis and relatedness analysis
* [pedprobr](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedprobr): Marker probabilities and pedigree likelihoods
* [ribd](https://github.com/magnusdv/ribd): Computation of pedigree-based relatedness coefficients
* [verbalisr](https://github.com/magnusdv/verbalisr): Textual descriptions of pedigree relationships

### Specialised packages
The following packages are devoted to special applications:

* [ibdsim2](https://github.com/magnusdv/ibdsim2): Simulation of identity-by-descent sharing by family members
* [dvir](https://github.com/thoree/dvir): Disaster victim identification
* [pedbuildr](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedbuildr): Pedigree reconstruction
* [paramlink2](https://github.com/magnusdv/paramlink2): Parametric linkage analysis
* [pedmut](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedmut): Mutation models for pedigree likelihood computations
* [segregatr](https://github.com/magnusdv/segregatr): Segregation analysis for clinical variant interpretation

### Retired packages
These packages have been superseded by other packages and are no longer compatible with the rest of the **ped suite**. They are maintained only for legacy purposes and should not be used in new projects.

* [paramlink](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=paramlink): This package marked the birth of the **ped suite**. Originally intended for parametric linkage analysis, it also contained the seeds of the current packages **pedtools**, **pedprobr**, **ribd** and **forrel**. 
* [IBDsim](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IBDsim): This is replaced by **ibdsim2**. (Regrettably, the name 'IBDsim' is very similar to that of the unrelated (non-R) software 'IBDSim' ([Leblois, Estoup & Rousset](http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/software/ibdsim/index.html)).)

### Imported packages

* [kinship2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=kinship2): Pedigree plotting in the **ped suite** depends on **kinship2** ([Sinnwell, Therneau & Schaid](https://doi.org/10.1159/000363105)) for pedigree alignment calculations.

## QuickPed - an online pedigree creator
In addition to the R packages, the **ped suite** also includes QuickPed, a free interactive program for creating and exploring pedigrees.
