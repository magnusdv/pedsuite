# ped suite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The **ped suite** is a collection of R packages for pedigree analysis, covering a variety of applications across several fields. The packages are designed to work harmoniously together, often allowing complex tasks to be solved in a few lines of code.

```{r logos-pedsuite, echo = F}
# pdftools::pdf_convert("man/figures/logos-pedsuite-wheel.pdf", format = "png", dpi = 300)
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/logos-pedsuite-wheel_1.png")
```

#### Core packages
At the center of the **ped suite** we find the **pedtools** package, on which all the others depend. In addition, several packages contain basic features often needed in many types of analysis. These are the *core* packages:

* [pedtools](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedtools): Creating and working with pedigrees and marker data
* [ribd](https://github.com/magnusdv/ribd): Computation of pedigree-based relatedness coefficients
* [pedprobr](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedprobr): Marker probabilities and pedigree likelihoods
* [pedmut](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedmut): Mutation models for pedigree likelihood computations
* [forrel](https://github.com/magnusdv/forrel): Forensic pedigree analysis and relatedness analysis

#### Specialised packages
The following packages are devoted to special applications:

* [ibdsim2](https://github.com/magnusdv/ibdsim2): Simulation of identity-by-descent sharing by family members
* [dvir](https://github.com/thoree/dvir): Disaster victim identification
* [pedbuildr](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedbuildr): Pedigree reconstruction
* [paramlink2](https://github.com/magnusdv/paramlink2): Parametric linkage analysis
* [segregatr](https://github.com/magnusdv/segregatr): Segregation analysis for clinical variant interpretation

#### Retired packages
These packages have been superseded by other packages and are no longer compatible with the rest of the **ped suite**. They are maintained only for legacy purposes and should not be used in new projects.

* [paramlink](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=paramlink): This package marked the birth of the **ped suite**. Originally intended for parametric linkage analysis, it also contained the seeds of the current packages **pedtools**, **pedprobr**, **ribd** and **forrel**. 
* [IBDsim](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IBDsim): This is replaced by **ibdsim2**. (Regrettably, the name 'IBDsim' is very similar to that of the unrelated (non-R) software 'IBDSim' ([Leblois, Estoup & Rousset](http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/software/ibdsim/index.html)).)

#### Imported packages

* [kinship2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IBDsim): All pedigree plots in the **ped suite** are internally made with the very nice **kinship2** package ([Sinnwell, Therneau & Schaid](https://doi.org/10.1159/000363105)). Creating nice pedigree plots is a highly non-trivial matter, so if you use the **ped suite** to create pedigree plots for publications, please also credit **kinship2**. 


## Installation

You can install the **ped suite** from [GitHub](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedsuite) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("magnusdv/pedsuite")
```

This will autmatically install all the individual **ped suite** packages. 

## QuickPed: A free online pedigree creator
[QuickPed](https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/quickped) is a free interactive web app for making pedigrees. In addition to drawing pedigrees, it also offers a few unique features, like relatedness coefficients, verbal descriptions of relationships, and storing pedigrees as text ('ped format'). 

QuickPed is based on the **ped suite** and was built with Shiny. [Try it out here!](https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/quickped)
