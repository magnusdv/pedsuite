# ISFG Summer School 2025

- Dates: September 4 & 5, 2025
- Where: Online, as part of [ISFG Summer School
  2025](https://isfgsummerschool.idloom.events/isfg-summer-school-virtual-edition-2025/)
- Teachers: Magnus Dehli Vigeland and Thore Egeland

## Description

The study of pedigrees and genetic relatedness is central in forensic
genetics. The aim of this course is to introduce the elegant statistical
foundations of relatedness, as well as several forensic applications. In
the basic course we focus on pedigree coefficients and likelihood ratios
for kinship analysis. We introduce the QuickPed app for drawing and
analysing pedigrees, and will also be using R for calculations and
visualisations. Lectures and exercises are based on the book [Pedigree
Analysis in
R](https://www.elsevier.com/books/pedigree-analysis-in-r/vigeland/978-0-12-824430-2).

The advanced session builds on the basic part, delving deeper into
applications and implementations of pedigree analysis in forensic
genetics. Main topics for this workshop include pedigree reconstruction
and disaster victim identification.

## Learning outcome

After completing the course the participants will have knowledge about:

- Classical concepts of statistical genetics and relatedness analysis
- How to produce informative and beautiful pedigree plots
- How to compute coefficients of relatedness
- How to perform kinship testing and pedigree reconstruction in R
- How to perform disaster victim identification with R and Diviana.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of genetics and probability
- Some previous experience with R is recommended, but not strictly
  required
- A recent version of [R](https://www.r-project.org) (at least 4.2) must
  be installed on your computer
- We recommend running R from
  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

The following R command installs the **pedsuite** packages, which will
be used throughout the course:

``` r
install.packages("pedsuite")
```
