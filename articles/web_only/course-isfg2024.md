# ISFG Congress 2024 Workshop

## Kinship Statistics and Pedigree Analysis

- Date: Tuesday, 10th of September, 2024
- Where: San Francisco Hotel Monumento, Santiago de Compostela, Spain
- Teachers: Magnus Dehli Vigeland and Thore Egeland
- ISFG 2024 workshops: <https://isfg2024.com/pre-congress-workshops/>

### Description

The study of pedigrees and genetic relatedness is central in forensic
genetics. The aim of this course is to introduce the elegant statistical
foundations of relatedness, as well as several forensic applications. In
certain parts we use R for calculations and visualisations. In the basic
session we will focus on pedigree coefficients and likelihood ratios for
kinship analysis. In addition, we will demonstrate QuickPed, an online
tool for creating pedigrees and computing relatedness:
<https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/quickped>

In the advanced part we will explore recently developed methods and
implementations for Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) and pedigree
reconstruction.

The course material is based on the book [Pedigree Analysis in
R](https://www.elsevier.com/books/pedigree-analysis-in-r/vigeland/978-0-12-824430-2)
(Vigeland ’21) and selected papers. Each session will alternate between
lectures and hands-on exercises. Solutions for all exercises will be
provided and discussed at the end of each session.

Attendance in the ‘Basic session’ is not required for the ‘Advanced
session’ for participants who are familiar with R.

### Learning outcome

After completing the course the participants will have knowledge about:

- Classical concepts of statistical genetics and relatedness analysis
- How to produce informative and beautiful pedigree plots
- How to compute coefficients of relatedness
- How to perform kinship testing and pedigree reconstruction in R
- How to perform disaster victim identification in R

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of genetics and probability
- All participants must bring a laptop with administrative rights
- A recent version of [R](https://www.r-project.org) (at least 4.1) must
  be installed on your computer
- Some previous experience with R is recommended, but not strictly
  required
- We strongly recommend running R from
  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
