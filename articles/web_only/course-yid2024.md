# Young Investigator Day 2024

## Workshop: Genetic relatedness

- Date: Monday 14th of October, 2024
- Where: Cancer Registry of Norway
- Teacher: Magnus Dehli Vigeland
- Part of the [NOFE conference](https://nofe.no/nofe-conference-2024/)
  (Norwegian Epidemiological Association)

### Description

The study of pedigrees and genetic relatedness is central in many
fields, including medical genetics, forensics and epidemiology. The aim
of this course is to introduce the elegant statistical foundations of
relatedness, as well as relevant software tools.

The workshop will alternate between lectures and hands-on exercises.
Some exercises use R, while others use *QuickPed*, a free online tool
for creating and analysing pedigrees:

The course material is based on the book [Pedigree Analysis in
R](https://www.elsevier.com/books/pedigree-analysis-in-r/vigeland/978-0-12-824430-2)
(Vigeland ’21), which may be a point of reference for participants who
want to delve deeper into the subject.

### Learning outcome

After completing the course the participants will have knowledge about:

- Classical concepts of statistical genetics and relatedness analysis
- How to produce informative and beautiful pedigree plots
- How to compute coefficients of relatedness
- Why some siblings are more related than others

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of genetics and probability
- All participants must bring a laptop with a recent version of R
  installed (at least 4.3.0)
- I strongly recommend running R from
  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
