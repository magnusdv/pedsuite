# ISFG 2026: Pre-congress workshop

## Pedigree analysis and relatedness inference

- Date: 18th of August, 2026
- Where: Montreal, Canada
- Teachers: Magnus Dehli Vigeland & Thore Egeland
- Duration: Full day workshop

### Description

The study of pedigrees and genetic relatedness is central in forensic
genetics. The aim of this course is to introduce the elegant statistical
foundations of relatedness, as well as several forensic applications. In
certain parts we use R for calculations and visualisations. In the basic
session we will focus on pedigree coefficients and likelihood ratios for
kinship analysis. In addition, we will demonstrate QuickPed, an online
tool for creating pedigrees and computing relatedness:

In the advanced part we will explore recently developed tools for
Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) and pedigree reconstruction.

The course material is based on the book [Pedigree Analysis in
R](https://www.elsevier.com/books/pedigree-analysis-in-r/vigeland/978-0-12-824430-2)
(Vigeland ’21) and selected papers. Each session will alternate between
lectures and hands-on exercises. Detailed solutions for all exercises
will be provided and discussed as needed.

Attendance in the ‘Basic session’ is not required for the ‘Advanced
session’ for participants who are familiar with R.

### Learning outcome

After completing the course the participants will have knowledge about:

- Classical concepts of statistical genetics and relatedness analysis
- How to produce informative and beautiful pedigree plots
- How to compute coefficients of relatedness
- How to perform kinship testing and pedigree reconstruction in R
- How to perform disaster victim identification in R

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of genetics and probability
- All participants must bring a laptop with administrative rights
- A recent version of [R](https://www.r-project.org) (at least v4.2)
  must be installed on your computer
- We strongly recommend running R from
  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
