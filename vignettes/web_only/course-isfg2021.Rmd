* Title: Pedigree analysis in R
* Dates: July 28-30, 2021
* Where: Online, as part of [ISFG Summer School 2021](https://isfgsummerschool.events.idloom.com/virtual-edition-2021))
* Teachers: Magnus Dehli Vigeland (MDV) and Thore Egeland (TE)

## Practicalities
Preparations: All participants must bring a laptop with the R software installed. We also highly recommend the Rstudio desktop version. For pedigree analysis in R we will use the ped suite, in particular the packages pedtools, pedprobr, ribd, and forrel.
Location: Room 1151 in the Domus Medica building.
Exam: The take home exam problems have been emailed to the participants. Data for the exam problems: snp_data_exam.ped, GM.fam.

## Schedule
The course runs from 14 to 18 (CEST) each day, with a 15 minutes break in the middle. The lectures are aimed at 55 minutes, allowing for a short interval before exercises.
